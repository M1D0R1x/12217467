# Logging Middleware Implementation Summary

## Overview

This Logging Middleware package provides a reusable function for making API calls to a test server for logging purposes. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the issue description, including validation of input parameters and proper error handling.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Logger Package**: The main package that contains the Log function and related utilities.
   - `Log(stack, level, pkg, message string) error`: The main function that validates inputs and sends log messages to the test server.
   - `LogWithRetry(stack, level, pkg, message string, maxRetries int) error`: An extended function that adds retry capability for handling network issues.

2. **Validation**: The package validates all input parameters according to the specified constraints:
   - Stack must be one of: "backend", "frontend"
   - Level must be one of: "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal"
   - Package must be valid for the specified stack

3. **API Integration**: The package makes HTTP POST requests to the test server at http://20.244.56.144/evaIuation-service/Iogs with the appropriate JSON payload.

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios, including invalid parameters, network issues, and server errors.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Import the Package**:
   ```go
   import "github.com/yourusername/logging-middleware/logger"
   ```

2. **Basic Logging**:
   ```go
   err := logger.Log("backend", "error", "handler", "received string, expected bool")
   if err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

3. **Logging with Retry**:
   ```go
   err := logger.LogWithRetry("backend", "fatal", "db", "Critical database connection failure", 3)
   if err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

## Integration Examples

The package includes an example application that demonstrates how to integrate the logging middleware into a web server. The example shows:

1. Logging HTTP requests
2. Logging warnings and errors
3. Logging debug information
4. Logging fatal errors

## Next Steps

To use this package in your application:

1. Clone or copy the Logging Middleware directory to your project
2. Update the import paths in your code to point to the correct location
3. Use the `Log` function throughout your codebase to log important events
4. Consider using the `LogWithRetry` function for critical logs that must be delivered

## Customization

You can customize the package by:

1. Adding authentication headers to the HTTP requests if needed
2. Extending the validation logic for specific use cases
3. Adding more logging levels or stacks as required
4. Implementing additional retry strategies or circuit breaker patterns

## Testing

To test the package:

1. Run the example application
2. Make requests to the endpoints (/hello and /db-error)
3. Check the console for any error messages
4. Verify that logs are being sent to the test server

## Conclusion

This Logging Middleware package provides a robust solution for logging application events to a remote server. It follows best practices for error handling, validation, and API integration, making it a reliable component for building observable applications.
